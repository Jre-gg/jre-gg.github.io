        <h4>Why is the map a pyramid?</h4>
        <p>You see, in most cases, the best or most important information/object is usually placed in the center. For example, on this page the homepage link is most important, so it would be in the center of the page. But that page belongs to our glorious leader! Putting it in the center is blasphemy!</p>

        <h4>Okay, but why is there a pyramid?!</h4>
        <p>I'm getting there, chill!</p>
        <p>Anyway, I struggled with this question: why were the best/most important things going in the center, when clearly they should be on the extremes?</p>

        <p>The answer was simple: </p>

        <p>They only <i>appeared</i> to be in the center.</p>

        <h4>What?!?!</h4>
        <p>I ran into this shocking discovery while researching the political compass. Everyone thinks of the political compass as a 2D square, and it is, right?</p>

        <p>Wrong.</p>

        <p>The political compass is actually a 3D square pyramid. It only looks like a square because everyone is viewing it from the bottom.</p>

        <h4>*mind blown*</h4>
        <p>My discovery explains quite a few things.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Why are there wacky ideologies? It's because they're located on the walls of the pyramid, not the base. This confused the centrists, who are incapable of thinking in 3D, so the centrists called them wacky.
          </li>
          <li>
            This also explains why so many people are drawn to centrism - they see the top of the pyramid, and want to be there, but since they only think in 2D they think it's the center.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>This literally makes no sense.</h4>
        <p>Shut up centrist.</p>
